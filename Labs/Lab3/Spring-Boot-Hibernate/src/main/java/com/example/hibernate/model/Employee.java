	 * When an Employee entity object is removed the remove operation is cascaded to
	 * the referenced Address entity object. In this regard, orphanRemoval=true and
	 * cascade=CascadeType.REMOVE are identical, and if orphanRemoval=true is
	 * specified, CascadeType.REMOVE is redundant.
	 * 
	 * The difference between the two settings is in the response to disconnecting a
	 * relationship. For example, such as when setting the address field to null or
	 * to another Address object. If orphanRemoval=true is specified the
	 * disconnected Address instance is automatically removed. This is useful for
	 * cleaning up dependent objects (e.g. Address) that should not exist without a
	 * reference from an owner object (e.g. Employee). If only
	 * cascade=CascadeType.REMOVE is specified no automatic action is taken since
	 * disconnecting a relationship is not a remove operation.
	 *
	 * Say your User has one-to-many relation to Comment. If you are using
	 * cascade="remove", you can remove the reference for Comment from one User, and
	 * then attach that Comment to another User. When you persist them, they will be
	 * correctly saved. But if you are using orphanRemoval=true, even if you will
	 * remove given Comment from one User, and then attach to another User, this
	 * comment will be deleted during persist, because the reference has been
	 * deleted.
	 *
	 * The reason why CascadeType.ALL is still needed because of other operations
	 * such as persist

# Lab 2 : Spring Security

A simple web application for login/logout/register using Spring Security.


I have used the dependencies : 

- Lombok - for reducing boilerplate code
- Java Mail Sender - simple api for sending email
- JPA - our lovely Object Relational Mapping (ORM) mapping tool
- H2 - in-memory database (feel free to use others)
- Spring Security - provides built-in authentication/authorization
- Spring Web - provides controllers and MVC support
- Rest Repositories - provides automatic restful controllers
- Validation - provides table validation such as @Email

And installed the dependencies : 

- Tomcat jasper - for working with jsp file
- Jackson xml - in case you would like to work with xml file
- JSTL - a jsp tagging library for looping, conditional logic


The application is composed by :

- Models : User and Role 
- Daos
- Spring Security 
- Service
- Validator 
- Controller
- Views

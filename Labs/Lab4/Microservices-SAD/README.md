# Lab 4 : Microservices + Kubernetes

This spring boot app is a simple note-taking which permits to implement and launch a local Kubernetes cluster and deploy it as a container in Kubernetes.
The app permits to write, save and display notes.

- To containerize this app, I used **Docker Container**, then it can run independently of the environment.

- I archived my container image in a container repository on Dockerhub.

- To deploy this app, I used **Kubernetes** and **Minikude**. Minikude permits to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster running in a virtual machine.

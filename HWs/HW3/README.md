# HW3

The aim of this assignment is to learn the concept of design patterns.
Among the 12 design patterns present in the guide provided by the professor, I have chosen to make 6 that could be useful in the realization of my project.

## Creational pattern

- Builder : Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations. I             have implemented these design patterns in 2 different ways, with Lombok (faster way) and without (traditionnal way). 

- Singleton : Ensure that a class has a single instance, and provide a global access point to it. I have implemented these design patterns in 2 different ways,                 with @Component (faster way) and without (traditionnal way). 

- Factory : Defines an interface for the creation of an object, but leaving the choice of classes to be instantiated to subclasses. It allows a class to delegate             instantiation to subclasses. 

## Structural pattern

- Adapter : Convert the interface of a class into another interface that is expected by a client and allows classes to collaborate that could not do so because               of the incompatibility of their interfaces.

- Decorator : Dynamically attaching additional capacities to an object and provide a flexible alternative to legacy to extend functionality.

## Behavioral pattern

- State : Modify the behaviour of an object when its internal state changes and obtain treatments according to current status.

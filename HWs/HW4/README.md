A simple web application for revenue recognition, inspired by Martin Fowler.

Users should be able to 
- (1) add contract which would insert revenue recognition
- (2) calculate recognized revenue as of some date

I developed this application in 2 different ways.

First is Transaction script using Table Data Gateway. 
Second is Domain model a cleaner way to implement it, using JPA.

A simple web application for revenue recognition, inspired by Martin Fowler.

Users should be able to 
-  Add contract which would insert revenue recognition
-  Calculate recognized revenue as of some date

I developed this application in 2 different ways.

First is *Transaction script* using Table Data Gateway.
Second is *Domain model* a cleaner way to implement it, using JPA.
